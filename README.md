# vicaty-server

This app is a full stack app made with react, node.js, express and antD, using passport for authenticacion, and Mongo for DB. IÂ´ve made this app with the intention to create something useful and backend focused. Vicaty has 3 repos. The main repo (vicaty-server) is in charge of handling the requests coming directly from the client (vicaty-client repo), Vicaty also has a repo for its API, which is in charge of handling all the requests coming from any external site (no passport authentication).
